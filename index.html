  <p>I'm a University student whose passion is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology">Technology</a>. Currently i'm pursuing Bachelor degree in <em>Human Resource Management</em>, don't lough as now you're on the webpage of Manager
    Developer...hahahaha yah it's complicated. Appart from Coding i do like story writting and telling, i spent most of time if not in my studies it will coding and if not, well it's story time. you may visit on my facebook and Twitter pages to
    Calrify this. Speaking of Codes, they are hard as F**k...you need not just a will power but also a passion to fall in love with these complicated stuff's. Sometimes you may stuck in one part for two weeks but luckily you get yourself out, but
    what i have learnt so far sinces i start to code is that...<strong>"NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE UNTILL IT'S IMPOSSIBLE"</strong> so, as long as you can push yourself and try harder and hader..trust me you can break the Rock. Now that you enjoy Reading
    my mixture of correct and uncorrect grammar and tenses, it's true that i don't know this Language but am trying hard and as the time goes on i'll get better and you'll not lough at me as you do now. No hard feelings..am just doing this Fun as
    this webpage is one of My trial's in Sukuma they said "Tunatest Mitambo". Come on!!!!</p>
